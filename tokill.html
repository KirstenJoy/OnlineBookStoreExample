        <p class="tokillp" id="div1"> When he was nearly thirteen, my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter
            than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was at right angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn't have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt. <br> <br> When enough years had gone by to enable
            us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to
            us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out. <br><br> I said if he wanted to take a broad view of the thing, it really began with Andrew Jackson. If General Jackson hadn't run the Creeks up the creek, Simon Finch would
            never have paddled up the Alabama, and where would we be if he hadn't? We were far too old to settle an argument with a fist-fight, so we consulted Atticus. Our father said we were both right. <br> <br> Being Southerners, it was a source of
            shame to some members of the family that we had no recorded ancestors on either side of the Battle of Hastings. All we had was Simon Finch, a fur-trapping apothecary from Cornwall whose piety was exceeded only by his stinginess. In England,
            Simon was irritated by the persecution of those who called themselves Methodists at the hands of their more liberal brethren, and as Simon called himself a Methodist, he worked his way across the Atlantic to Philadelphia, thence to Jamaica,
            thence to Mobile, and up the Saint Stephens. Mindful of John Wesley's strictures on the use of many words in buying and selling, Simon made a pile practicing medicine, but in this pursuit he was unhappy lest he be tempted into doing what he
            knew was not for the glory of God, as the putting on of gold and costly apparel. So Simon, having forgotten his teacher's dictum on the possession of human chattels, bought three slaves and with their aid established a homestead on the banks
            of the Alabama River some forty miles above Saint Stephens. He returned to Saint Stephens only once, to find a wife, and with her established a line that ran high to daughters. Simon lived to an impressive age and died rich. <br><br> It was
            customary for the men in the family to remain on Simon's homestead, Finch's Landing, and make their living from cotton. The place was self-sufficient: modest in comparison with the empires around it, the Landing nevertheless produced everything
            required to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles of clothing, supplied by river-boats from Mobile. <br><br> Simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the North and the South, as it left his descendants
            stripped of everything but their land, yet the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth century, when my father, Atticus Finch, went to Montgomery to read law, and his younger brother went to Boston to
            study medicine. Their sister Alexandra was the Finch who remained at the Landing: she married a taciturn man who spent most of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot-lines were full. <br><br> When my father was admitted
            to the bar, he returned to Maycomb and began his practice. Maycomb, some twenty miles east of Finch's Landing, was the county seat of Maycomb County. Atticus's office in the courthouse contained little more than a hat rack, a spittoon, a checkerboard
            and an unsullied Code of Alabama. His first two clients were the last two persons hanged in the Maycomb County jail. Atticus had urged them to accept the state's generosity in allowing them to plead Guilty to second-degree murder and escape
            with their lives, but they were Haverfords, in Maycomb County a name synonymous with jackass. The Haverfords had dispatched Maycomb's leading blacksmith in a misunderstanding arising from the alleged wrongful detention of a mare, were imprudent
            enough to do it in the presence of three witnesses, and insisted that the-son-of-a-bitch-had-it-coming-to-him was a good enough defense for anybody. They persisted in pleading Not Guilty to first-degree murder, so there was nothing much Atticus
            could do for his clients except be present at their departure, an occasion that was probably the beginning of my father's profound distaste for the practice of criminal law. <br><br> During his first five years in Maycomb, Atticus practiced
            economy more than anything; for several years thereafter he invested his earnings in his brother's education. John Hale Finch was ten years younger than my father, and chose to study medicine at a time when cotton was not worth growing; but
            after getting Uncle Jack started, Atticus derived a reasonable income from the law. He liked Maycomb, he was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they knew him, and because of Simon Finch's industry, Atticus was related by blood
            or marriage to nearly every family in the town. <br><br> Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the
            square. Somehow, it was hotter then: a black dog suffered on a summer's day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies
            bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum. <br><br> People moved slowly then. They ambled across the square, shuffled in and out of the stores around
            it, took their time about everything. A day was twenty-four hours long but seemed longer. There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County.
            <br><br> But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people: Maycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself. <br><br> We lived on the main residential street in town- Atticus, Jem and I, plus Calpurnia
            our cook. Jem and I found our father satisfactory: he played with us, read to us, and treated us with courteous detachment. <br><br> Calpurnia was something else again. She was all angles and bones; she was nearsighted; she squinted; her hand
            was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard. She was always ordering me out of the kitchen, asking me why I couldn't behave as well as Jem when she knew he was older, and calling me home when I wasn't ready to come. Our battles were epic and
            one-sided. Calpurnia always won, mainly because Atticus always took her side. She had been with us ever since Jem was born, and I had felt her tyrannical presence as long as I could remember. <br><br> Our mother died when I was two, so I never
            felt her absence. She was a Graham from Montgomery; Atticus met her when he was first elected to the state legislature. He was middle-aged then, she was fifteen years his junior. Jem was the product of their first year of marriage; four years
            later I was born, and two years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack. They said it ran in her family. I did not miss her, but I think Jem did. He remembered her clearly, and sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length,
            then go off and play by himself behind the car-house. When he was like that, I knew better than to bother him. <br><br> When I was almost six and Jem was nearly ten, our summertime boundaries (within calling distance of Calpurnia) were Mrs.
            Henry Lafayette Dubose's house two doors to the north of us, and the Radley Place three doors to the south. We were never tempted to break them. The Radley Place was inhabited by an unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to
            make us behave for days on end; Mrs. Dubose was plain hell. <br><br> That was the summer Dill came to us. <br><br> Early one morning as we were beginning our day's play in the back yard, Jem and I heard something next door in Miss Rachel Haverford's
            collard patch. We went to the wire fence to see if there was a puppy- Miss Rachel's rat terrier was expecting- instead we found someone sitting looking at us. Sitting down, he wasn't much higher than the collards. We stared at him until he
            spoke: <br><br> "Hey." <br><br> "Hey yourself," said Jem pleasantly. <br><br> "I'm Charles Baker Harris," he said. "I can read." <br><br> "So what?" I said. <br><br> "I just thought you'd like to know I can read. You got anything needs readin'
            I can do it...." <br><br> "How old are you," asked Jem, "four-and-a-half?" <br><br> "Goin' on seven." <br><br> "Shoot no wonder, then," said Jem, jerking his thumb at me. "Scout yonder's been readin' ever since she was born, and she ain't
            even started to school yet. You look right puny for goin' on seven." <br><br> "I'm little but I'm old," he said. <br><br> Jem brushed his hair back to get a better look. "Why don't you come over, Charles Baker Harris?" he said. "Lord, what
            a name." <br><br> "'s not any funnier'n yours. Aunt Rachel says your name's Jeremy Atticus Finch." <br><br> Jem scowled. "I'm big enough to fit mine," he said. "Your name's longer'n you are. Bet it's a foot longer." <br><br> "Folks call me
            Dill," said Dill, struggling under the fence. <br><br> "Do better if you go over it instead of under it," I said. <br><br> Where'd you come from? <br><br> Dill was from Meridian, Mississippi, was spending the summer with his aunt, Miss Rachel,
            and would be spending every summer in Maycomb from now on. His family was from Maycomb County originally, his mother worked for a photographer in Meridian, had entered his picture in a Beautiful Child contest and won five dollars. She gave
            the money to Dill, who went to the picture show twenty times on it. <br><br> "Don't have any picture shows here, except Jesus ones in the courthouse sometimes," said Jem. "Ever see anything good?" <br><br> Dill had seen ®Dracula,¯ * a revelation
            that moved Jem to eye him with the beginning of respect. "Tell it to us," he said. <br><br> Dill was a curiosity. He wore blue linen shorts that buttoned to his shirt, his hair was snow white and stuck to his head like duckfluff; he was a
            year my senior but I towered over him. As he told us the old tale his blue eyes would lighten and darken; his laugh was sudden and happy; he habitually pulled at a cowlick in the center of his forehead. <br><br> When Dill reduced Dracula to
            dust, and Jem said the show sounded better than the book, I asked Dill where his father was: "You ain't said anything about him." <br><br> "I haven't got one." <br><br> "Is he dead?" <br><br> "No..." <br><br> "Then if he's not dead you've
            got one, haven't you?" <br><br> Dill blushed and Jem told me to hush, a sure sign that Dill had been studied and found acceptable. Thereafter the summer passed in routine contentment. Routine contentment was: improving our treehouse that rested
            between giant twin chinaberry trees in the back yard, fussing, running through our list of dramas based on the works of Oliver Optic, Victor Appleton, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. In this matter we were lucky to have Dill. He played the character
            parts formerly thrust upon me- the ape in Tarzan,¯ Mr. Crabtree in The Rover Boys,¯ Mr. Damon in Tom Swift.¯ Thus we came to know Dill as a pocket Merlin, whose head teemed with eccentric plans, strange longings, and quaint fancies. <br><br>            But by the end of August our repertoire was vapid from countless reproductions, and it was then that Dill gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out. <br><br> The Radley Place fascinated Dill. In spite of our warnings and explanations
            it drew him as the moon draws water, but drew him no nearer than the light-pole on the corner, a safe distance from the Radley gate. There he would stand, his arm around the fat pole, staring and wondering. <br><br>
